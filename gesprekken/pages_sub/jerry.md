<h4>Jerry</h4>

<p><em>Ik</em>&nbsp; Hi! Sorry to bother you — I’m doing a project for my website, where I talk to people I meet by chance. Just small conversations about life. Would you be up for that?</p>

<p><em>Jerry</em>&nbsp; Hmm… sure, why not. Sounds interesting. What do you want to ask me?</p>

<p><em>Ik</em>&nbsp; First of all — what’s your name, and what brought you to the Netherlands?</p>

<p><em>Jerry</em>&nbsp; My name is Jerry. I came here from Eritrea, with a few friends. That was three years ago. We left because of the situation there… It’s not easy to explain shortly, but let’s say there wasn’t much future for us.</p>

<p><em>Ik</em>&nbsp; I understand. And what do you do now, here?</p>

<p><em>Jerry</em>&nbsp; I work in a hotel, as a dishwasher. It’s not my dream, but it’s a start. I’m happy to have a job and be safe. And I’m learning. Dutch, mostly, but also how everything works here.</p>

<p><em>Ik</em>&nbsp; Your Dutch sounds pretty good already.</p>

<p><em>Jerry</em>&nbsp; Thanks! I practice a lot. But English is still easier for me to really explain myself. Dutch is… tricky!</p>

<p><em>Ik</em>&nbsp; Did you study before, back in Eritrea?</p>

<p><em>Jerry</em>&nbsp; Yes, I started engineering. I didn’t finish, because we had to leave. That was really hard for me. I love mathematics, physics… all that logic. But I try to stay positive. I believe someday I will study again.</p>

<p><em>Ik</em>&nbsp; That sounds very strong. What helps you keep that hope?</p>

<p><em>Jerry</em>&nbsp; My faith. And my friends. We came together, and we talk a lot. About what we lost, but also what we still want. And I try to be grateful for small things. A quiet room, good coffee, nice weather. You have to build from the ground up.</p>

<p><em>Ik</em>&nbsp; That’s beautiful, really. Do you feel welcome here?</p>

<p><em>Jerry</em>&nbsp; Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Some people are kind and curious. Others are afraid, I think. But I try not to let that make me bitter. I believe respect goes both ways. I always smile first.</p>

<p><em>Ik</em>&nbsp; Is there something you wish more people knew about people like you?</p>

<p><em>Jerry</em>&nbsp; That we’re not lazy. That we’re not dangerous. We didn’t come here to take — we came to live. And to contribute, if we get the chance.</p>

<p><em>Ik</em>&nbsp; Thank you, Jerry. I really appreciate this conversation.</p>

<p><em>Jerry</em>&nbsp; I do too. It’s not often that someone just asks, and really listens.</p>

<p><em>Ik</em>&nbsp; I wish you all the best. And I hope one day I hear about engineer Jerry.</p>

<p><em>Jerry</em>&nbsp; Me too! Thank you so much.</p>
