Het botsen van alledaagse intuïtie op kwantum-verstrenge- ling, tijdsdilatatie, informatieparadoxen, en het raadsel van bewustzijn als mogelijk fundamenteel aspect van het universum.

Denk aan retrocausaliteit, het holografisch universum, zelforganiserende systemen, en de vraag of de waarnemer de werkelijkheid mede cre-ëert. Weird Science is geen sciencefiction, het is wel een uitnodiging om onze diepste aannames over tijd, ruimte en bestaan te herzien."
