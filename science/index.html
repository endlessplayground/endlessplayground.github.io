              This is the start of the paragraph with a small image embedded at the beginning.
              The image should stretch to match the height of two lines of text.

          <p>By measuring brain activity using various neuroscientific technologies, we can acquire additional information useful for deciphering another person’s state of mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(73, 176, 245);">▶</span></p>

          <p>Attempts to understand consciousness have been pervasive throughout human history, mostly dominated by philosophical analyses focused on.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(73, 176, 245);">▶</span></p>

          <p>The challenge for this combination of approaches is to give a comprehensive explanation of consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(73, 176, 245);">▶</span></p>

          <p>At the outset, a central question is how to conceive of consciousness relative to other things we know. Objects in our environment have a physical basis?&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(73, 176, 245);">▶</span></p>

          <p>Rene Descartes’ position, dualism, was that mental and physical are, in essence, different substances. This view can be contrasted.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(73, 176, 245);">▶</span></p>

          <p>A prominent orientation to the scientific study of consciousness is to seek understanding of these dependencies—to see how much light they can shed on consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(73, 176, 245);">▶</span></p>

          <p>Suppose you meet your friend at a crowded train station. You may notice a subtle smile on her face. At that moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(73, 176, 245);">▶</span></p>

          <p>For instance, you may think that if you attentively look at a bright spot, you must be aware of it. Not so. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(73, 176, 245);">▶</span></p>

          <p>Are you really aware of everything that is going on around you? In the context of a crowded train station you may be visually aware of certain things.</p>

          <p>You may think that if you deeply analyze an image, decoding its meaning and making a decision about it, you must be aware of the image. Not necessarily.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(73, 176, 245);">▶</span></p>

          <p>Thus, neither the brightness of an image, paying full attention to it, nor deeply analyzing it guarantees that you will be aware of it. What, then, is the crucial?&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(73, 176, 245);">▶</span></p>

          <p>A contemporary answer is that our awareness of a visual feature depends on a certain type of reciprocal exchange of information across multiple brain areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(73, 176, 245);">▶</span></p>
