                    This is the start of the paragraph with a small image embedded at the beginning.

<p><img src="../science/images/conscious.svg" alt="icon" class="paragraph-icon">By measuring brain activity using various neuroscientific technologies, we can acquire additional information useful for deciphering another person’s state of mind. <img src="/images/read.svg" alt="" class="read"></p>

<p><img src="../science/images/conscious.svg" alt="icon" class="paragraph-icon">Attempts to understand consciousness have been pervasive throughout human history, mostly dominated by philosophical analyses focused on.  <img src="/images/read.svg" alt="" class="read"></p>

<p><img src="../science/images/conscious.svg" alt="icon" class="paragraph-icon">The challenge for this combination of approaches is to give a comprehensive explanation of consciousness.&nbsp;<img src="/images/read.svg" alt="" class="read"></p>

<p><img src="../science/images/conscious.svg" alt="icon" class="paragraph-icon">At the outset, a central question is how to conceive of consciousness relative to other things we know. Objects in our environment have a physical basis? <img src="/images/read.svg" alt="" class="read"></p>

<p><img src="../science/images/conscious.svg" alt="icon" class="paragraph-icon">Rene Descartes’ position, dualism, was that mental and physical are, in essence, different substances. This view can be contrasted. <img src="/images/read.svg" alt="" class="read"></p>

<p><img src="../science/images/conscious.svg" alt="icon" class="paragraph-icon">A prominent orientation to the scientific study of consciousness is to seek understanding of these dependencies—to see how much light they can shed on consciousness. <img src="/images/read.svg" alt="" class="read"></p>


<p><img src="../science/images/conscious.svg" alt="icon" class="paragraph-icon">Suppose you meet your friend at a crowded train station. You may notice a subtle smile on her face. At that moment. <img src="/images/read.svg" alt="" class="read"></p>

<p><img src="../science/images/conscious.svg" alt="icon" class="paragraph-icon">For instance, you may think that if you attentively look at a bright spot, you must be aware of it. Not so.  <img src="/images/read.svg" alt="" class="read"></p>

<p><img src="../science/images/conscious.svg" alt="icon" class="paragraph-icon">Are you really aware of everything that is going on around you? In the context of a crowded train station you may be visually aware of certain things.</p>

<p><img src="../science/images/conscious.svg" alt="icon" class="paragraph-icon">You may think that if you deeply analyze an image, decoding its meaning and making a decision about it, you must be aware of the image. Not necessarily. <img src="/images/read.svg" alt="" class="read"></p>

<p><img src="../science/images/conscious.svg" alt="icon" class="paragraph-icon">Thus, neither the brightness of an image, paying full attention to it, nor deeply analyzing it guarantees that you will be aware of it. What, then, is the crucial? <img src="/images/read.svg" alt="" class="read"></p>

<p>A contemporary answer is that our awareness of a visual feature depends on a certain type of reciprocal exchange of information across multiple brain areas. <img src="/images/read.svg" alt="" class="read"></p>
