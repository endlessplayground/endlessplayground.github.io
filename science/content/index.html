            <h2>consciousness relative to other things we know</h2>

                <p>To delve into this topic, some terminology must first be considered. Consciousness can also refer to the state of an individual, as in a sharp or dull state of consciousness, a drug-induced state such as euphoria, or a diminished state due to drowsiness, sleep, neurological abnormality, or coma. In this module, we focus not on states of consciousness or on self-consciousness, but rather on the process that unfolds in the course of a conscious experience—a moment of awareness—the essential ingredient of consciousness.</p>

                <h3>Other Minds</h3>
                <p>You have probably experienced the sense of knowing exactly what a friend is thinking... By measuring brain activity using various neuroscientific technologies... Attempts to understand consciousness have been pervasive throughout human history...</p>

                <h3>A Science of Consciousness</h3>
                <p>The challenge for this combination of approaches is to give a comprehensive explanation of consciousness... At the outset, a central question is how to conceive of consciousness relative to other things we know... Rene Descartes’ position, dualism, was that mental and physical are, in essence, different substances... A prominent orientation to the scientific study of consciousness is to seek understanding of these dependencies...</p>

                <h3>Conscious Experiences of Visual Perception</h3>
                <p>Suppose you meet your friend at a crowded train station... For instance, you may think that if you attentively look at a bright spot, you must be aware of it... Are you really aware of everything that is going on around you? You may think that if you deeply analyze an image...</p>

                <p>Thus, neither the brightness of an image, paying full attention to it, nor deeply analyzing it guarantees awareness... A contemporary answer is that our awareness of a visual feature depends on a certain type of reciprocal exchange of information across multiple brain areas... This idea can also explain why people with certain types of brain damage lack visual awareness... If exchanges of information across brain areas are crucial for generating visual awareness...</p>

                <p>A related view, the Information Integration Theory of Consciousness, is that shared information itself constitutes consciousness... Computational analyses provide additional perspectives on such proposals...</p>
