        <p>By measuring brain activity using various neuroscientific technologies, we can acquire additional information useful for deciphering another person’s state of mind. Attempts to understand consciousness have been pervasive throughout human history, mostly dominated by philosophical analyses focused on. The challenge for this combination of approaches is to give a comprehensive explanation of consciousness. At the outset, a central question is how to conceive of consciousness relative to other things we know. <p> Objects in our environment have a physical basis? Rene Descartes’ position, dualism, was that mental and physical are, in essence, different substances. This view can be contrasted.</p>
           <p> A prominent orientation to the scientific study of consciousness is to seek understanding of these dependencies—to see how much light they can shed on consciousness. Suppose you meet your friend at a crowded train station. You may notice a subtle smile on her face. At that moment. For instance, you may think that if you attentively look at a bright spot, you must be aware of it. Not so. Are you really aware of everything that is going on around you? In the context of a crowded train station you may be visually aware of certain things.</p><p> You may think that if you deeply analyze an image, decoding its meaning and making a decision about it, you must be aware of the image.</p> Not necessarily. Thus, neither the brightness of an image, paying full attention to it, nor deeply analyzing it guarantees that you will be aware of it. What, then, is the crucial? A contemporary answer is that our awareness of a visual feature depends on a certain type of reciprocal exchange of information across multiple brain areas.</p>
